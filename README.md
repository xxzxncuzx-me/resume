Junior Frontend Developer Resume Website

This is a personal website created as a junior frontend developer resume using Create-React-App, JavaScript, and SCSS. The website consists of four pages - Home, Portfolio, Resume and Contacts.


Features

Home page features a photograph and introduction text, which gives visitors an insight into the developer's skills. 

The Resume page showcases the developer's CV and a download button for easy access. Provides a detailed summary of education, work experience, and technical skills.

The Portfolio page displays some of previous works with screenshots and short descriptions. The carousel component has been added to enable easy navigation and a better user experience.

Finally, the Contacts page includes links to social media profiles.

To ensure that the website is fully responsive, it has been made adaptive, which means that it looks great on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. For smaller devices I added a custom burger menu, making the website more user-friendly and easier to navigate.
